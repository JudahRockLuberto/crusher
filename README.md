# crusher
Used to process data from all TNG sizes.

# notes
Foundation of code taken from Song's riker: https://github.com/dr-guangtou/riker. Although, different functions and flexibility were added (this repo was created to work with all TNG files).


Also note that the higher-level functions have flexibility and let you know what certain data to use, while the lower-level functions may not (like some in crusher.galaxy or crusher.data). The demo codes should give you a good idea of what to use.
